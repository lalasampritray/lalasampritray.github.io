Abstract
---

Researchers and roboticists face one of the most complex problems of solving inverse kinematics while designing the robotic manipulator. For the sake of this research, a Deep Artificial neural network (DANN) model is used to solve the inverse kinematics of a 5-axis serial link robotic manipulator. The joints in this robotic manipulator are rotary. MATLAB is used to train the proposed DANN model. Transformation matrix and forward kinematics of the robotic manipulator is used for generation of the training dataset. An experimental robotic model is constructed to authenticate inverse calculations made by this model. A Basler ACA smart camera system is connected with MATLAB. This arrangement calculates deviation at the end needle in real-time. Image processing is used for this purpose. Results of training of DANN showed that there was a deviation of ±0.1 rad in each joint. This result feed-forward satisfactory as it was also validated experimentally. Even with fewer input data, one could achieve the desired target coordinate points with a robotic manipulator using the proposed method.
